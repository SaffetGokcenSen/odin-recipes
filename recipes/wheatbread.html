        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe for a delicious wheat bread. It is simple to make.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups warm water (110 degress F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
            <li>5 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>3 Â½ cups whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix warm water, yeast, and 1/3 cup honey. Add 5 cups white bread flour, and stir to combine. Let set for 30 minutes, or until big and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Mix in 3 tablespoons melted butter, remaining 1/3 cup honey, and salt. Stir in 2 cups whole wheat flour. Flour a flat surface and knead with whole wheat flour until not real sticky - just pulling away from the counter, but still sticky to touch. This may take an additional 2 to 4 cups of whole wheat flour. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to coat the surface of the dough. Cover with a dishtowel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled.</li>
            <li>Punch down, and divide into 3 loaves. Place in greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans, and allow to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes; do not overbake. Lightly brush the tops of loaves with 2 tablespoons melted butter or margarine when done to prevent crust from getting hard. Cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
